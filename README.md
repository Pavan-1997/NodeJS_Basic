# NodeJS_Basics

-> JS - PROGRAMING LANGUAGE

-> Java Script Engine which converts JS code to machine code 

-> Different browsers use different JS Engines - First Engine was SpiderMonkey by the creator of JS (Netscape)

-> Chrome has a JS Engine as V8 - Edge is build on chromium based on V8 - V8 become the most popular - V8 was converting to machine code faster 

-> NodeJS is a runtime environment where we can run JS on a physical machine that uses V8 JS Engine

-> NodeJS with HTTP module can be used at the Server side

-> NPM (Node Package Manager) - Gives modules
