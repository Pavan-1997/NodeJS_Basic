# NodeJS_Basics 

- JS - PROGRAMING LANGUAGE
 
- Java Script Engine which converts JS code to machine code

- Different browsers use different JS Engines - First Engine was SpiderMonkey by the creator of JS (Netscape)

- Chrome has a JS Engine as V8 - Edge is build on chromium based on V8 - V8 become the most popular - V8 was converting to machine code faster 

- NodeJS is a runtime environment where we can run JS on a physical machine that uses V8 JS Engine

- NodeJS with HTTP module can be used at the Server side

- NPM (Node Package Manager) - Gives modules

- Versions in NodeJS
